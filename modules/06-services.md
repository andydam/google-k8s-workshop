Services
========

Module objectives
-----------------

- create canary and production services
- examine Load Balancer IP in the Cloud Console

---

Theory
------

A service is an abstraction for pods, providing a stable, virtual IP (VIP) address.

While pods may come and go, services allow clients to reliably connect to the containers running in the pods, using the VIP. The virtual in VIP means itâ€™s not an actual IP address connected to a network interface but its purpose is purely to forward traffic to one or more pods.

Keeping the mapping between the VIP and the pods up-to-date is the job of kube-proxy, a process that runs on every node, which queries the API server to learn about new services in the cluster.

Service Without Selectors Use cases:

- Non-Kubernetes service
- Local service, e.g., local database
- Different cluster / namespace

Service types

- ClusterIP: Creates a VIP in a pod network, not accessible from outside
- NodePort: Allocates a port from dynamic range (30000-32767) for every node
- LoadBalancer: Creates an Cloud load balancer

Proxy modes

- userspace
- iptables
- ipvs

Applications can discover services using enviornmental variables or DNS. DNS requires cluster addon like `kube-dns` or `coreDNS`.

1. Create the canary and production services:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl --namespace=prod apply -f k8s/services
    ```

1.  Run `kubectl --namespace=prod get services` to list all services.

1. Retrieve the External IP for the production services: **This field may take a few minutes to appear as the load balancer is being provisioned**:

  ```shell
  $ kubectl --namespace=prod get service gceme-frontend
  NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
  gceme-frontend   LoadBalancer   10.35.254.91   35.196.48.78   80:31088/TCP   1m
  ```

1. Confirm that both services are working by opening the frontend external IP in your browser

```shell
$ kubectl --namespace=prod get service gceme-frontend -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}{"\n"}'
http://35.196.48.78
```

1. In GCP Cloud Console, find and investigate the external IP address that the `LoadBalancer` service type created
    * VPC Network -> External IP addresses


Exercises
---------

1. Optional: Investigate source code of the sample

    Look at manifests in `k8s/services` folder
